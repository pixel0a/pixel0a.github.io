```cpp
Entity entity;
std::cout << entity.X << std::endl;
```

Coming from C#/Java/etc, looks like we might get a `NullPointerException` here but we actually don't. C++ calls the default constructor here, if it is defined.

---

```cpp
Entity entity = Entity("wow");
Entity entity("wow"); // same thing
```
alt syntax

---

In base class, mark destructor as `virtual` otherwise it will be hidden by derived class that implement destructors = memory leaks. In `.h`:

```cpp
class Entity {
public:
    virtual ~Entity();
};
```

---

Instead of deref pointer, can use arrow operator (?)

```cpp
Entity* entity = new Entity();
std::cout << (*entity).GetName(); << std::endl;
// gleich von
std::cout << entity->GetName(); << std::endl;
```

---

Can check for memory leaks using `valgrind`. An output like this is what you want:

```
==24579== HEAP SUMMARY:
==24579==     in use at exit: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==24579==   total heap usage: 24 allocs, 24 frees, 74,365 bytes allocated
==24579== 
==24579== All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible
==24579== 
==24579== For counts of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -v
==24579== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)
```

---

`struct` is essentially the same as `class` except `struct` is there due to backwards compatibility with `C` (which doesn't have classes). I would use `struct`s and `classes` similarly to how I would use the two in C#, but NB: in C++ `struct`s can actually have methods.

---

Iterate through `list` (C++11):

```cpp
for (auto& input : list) {
}
```

---

In C++, gibt es kein einfach Weg, das String von ein Enum zu bekommen. Also muss man etwas wie so machen:

```cpp
enum ExprType{
    NONE,
    OR,
    AND,
    NOT
};
static const char* ExprTypeStrs[] = {"NONE","OR","AND","NOT"};

std::cout << ExprTypeStrs[ExprType::AND] << std::endl;
```

---

Also, it is bad design practice to try and work out if an object is an instance of some class at runtime to do some alternate behavior. Instead, use (pure) _virtual methods_ and polymorphism.

If you have:

```cpp
class Base;
class A : public Base {...};
class B : public Base {...};

void foo(Base *p)
{
  if(/* p is A */) /* do X */
  else /* do Y */
}
```

Then it is better to:

```cpp
class Base
{
  virtual void bar() = 0;
};

class A : public Base
{
  void bar() {/* do X */}
};

class B : public Base
{
  void bar() {/* do Y */}
};

void foo(Base *p)
{
  p->bar();
}
```

Otherwise you'd be violating the [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle) and that's sad :(

[To string](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5590381/easiest-way-to-convert-int-to-string-in-c):

```cpp
#include <string>
std::string s = std::to_string(3435);
```
